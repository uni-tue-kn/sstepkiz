# Deployment

There are multiple devices to deploy:

- The [Aggregator Device](./aggregator-device/README.md) for the patients. 
- The [IMeRa and Keycloak Server](./imera-package/README.md) for debugging purposes.
- The [SSteP-KiZ Server](./sstepkiz-server/README.md) that runs the SSteP-KiZ specific services.

A deployment guide is provided for each of them.
